A small group of elite small gangers left to find some fair fights and they had packed their nighmares with some fairly good abyssaled faction modules. When asked why they spent so much Devoin just explained \"If we left with cheaper ship fits then they would have to reship too often\" which makes sence to me. after they killed a few locals wondering through everyone in the area warped to structures and tethered up. then a couple minutes of no content they put together an asternomical force of 10+ people in caracals and ospreys, and thats wheere the issues come in. How could CCP just allow everyone to put down citedels everywhere. Look at how it killed the content and allowed the locals to reship into a well fit fleet of unfightable odds. \"We often don't take fights like this. When they have time to reship we fear losing one of out nightmares is just too much of a loss\""
